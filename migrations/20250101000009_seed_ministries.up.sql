    '<h2>Rooted in the Word</h2>
<p>Sunday School at Saint Andrew''s Chapel is not merely a supplementary program — it is a cornerstone of our educational ministry. We believe that the people of God are nourished by careful, systematic instruction in Holy Scripture and the Reformed confessions. Each Sunday morning at 9:15 AM, before the corporate worship service, our congregation gathers by age group to study the Word together.</p>
<h2>Classes for Every Stage of Life</h2>
<p>We offer classes for nursery through adults, each carefully designed to meet learners where they are. Children move through a sequential curriculum grounded in the Westminster Shorter Catechism, learning to answer the great questions of the faith: Who is God? What is sin? How are sinners saved? Our adult classes engage in expository study of Scripture alongside readings from the Reformed heritage — Calvin, Owen, Bavinck, and others who have fed the church through the centuries.</p>
<h2>Teaching the Faith to the Next Generation</h2>
<p>We take seriously the covenant promise made at baptism: that parents and the congregation together will raise children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Sunday School is one of the primary means by which we fulfill that vow. Teachers are carefully selected, trained, and supported by the session. We seek not merely to impart information but to form disciples whose minds are shaped by Scripture and whose hearts are stirred to love and obedience.</p>
<h2>Join Us</h2>
<p>Visitors and prospective members are warmly welcome in our adult class, which currently meets in the Fellowship Hall. If you have questions about our curriculum or would like to speak with our Director of Christian Education, please contact us at the email below.</p>'

    '<h2>Women Growing Together in Grace</h2>
<p>The Women''s Ministry of Saint Andrew''s Chapel exists to encourage and equip women to know Christ more deeply, love one another more faithfully, and serve the body of Christ more joyfully. We believe that the Scriptures speak directly and richly to women''s lives, and we seek to open that Word together through study, prayer, and honest conversation.</p>
<h2>Weekly Bible Study</h2>
<p>Our primary gathering is a Tuesday morning Bible study that meets throughout the academic year. We work through books of Scripture using careful inductive methods, always asking: What does this text say? What does it mean? How does it apply to my life? Current and upcoming studies are announced in the weekly bulletin. A nursery is available for young children, and we make every effort to accommodate mothers with infants.</p>
<h2>Fellowship and Hospitality</h2>
<p>Beyond formal study, we gather for seasonal events that build the bonds of Christian friendship — retreats, shared meals, book discussions, and service projects. We are committed to the biblical vision of older women teaching younger women, of the more experienced walking alongside those just beginning their journey of faith. Whether you are new to Saint Andrew''s or have worshipped here for decades, you will find a place among us.</p>
<h2>Service to the Body</h2>
<p>Women''s Ministry also coordinates many of the mercy and hospitality functions of the congregation: meal trains for new mothers and the ill, care packages for college students, and support for our international mission partners. We believe that loving service is not separate from spiritual growth but its natural fruit.</p>'

    '<h2>Raising Up the Next Generation</h2>
<p>The Youth Ministry of Saint Andrew''s Chapel is committed to the discipleship of students in grades 6 through 12. We believe that young people are not merely the church of tomorrow — they are the church of today, called to worship, serve, and bear witness to Christ in their schools, families, and communities. Our aim is to root students in the truth of God''s Word, the community of the covenant people, and the living hope of the gospel.</p>
<h2>Sunday Evening Fellowship</h2>
<p>Youth Group meets each Sunday evening at 5:00 PM in the Youth Room. Our gatherings include worship, Scripture teaching, small group discussion, and plenty of time for the kind of honest conversation that teenagers need. We work through systematic teaching on the Westminster Shorter Catechism alongside topical series addressing the questions students are actually asking: What is the purpose of my life? How do I think about faith and science? What does the Bible say about identity, relationships, and vocation?</p>
<h2>Events and Retreats</h2>
<p>Throughout the year, the youth participate in retreats, service projects, and fellowship events. An annual fall retreat and a spring service trip anchor the calendar. These experiences are designed to deepen friendships, test and strengthen faith, and give students a vision for what it means to live for Christ in the world. We also participate in regional Reformed youth events and the denominational youth conference each summer.</p>
<h2>Parents as Partners</h2>
<p>We believe that parents are the primary disciplers of their children, and our ministry exists to support and supplement that work — not to replace it. We communicate regularly with parents, invite their involvement, and seek to align our teaching with what students are hearing at home and in Sunday School. If you would like to discuss your student''s spiritual growth or get involved as a volunteer, we would love to hear from you.</p>'

    '<h2>Singing to the Glory of God</h2>
<p>The Music Ministry of Saint Andrew''s Chapel understands corporate song as an act of worship, not performance. We are shaped by the conviction that the church''s singing is a theological act — a confession of faith set to melody — and that excellence in music is rendered to God, not to an audience. Our approach to worship music is rooted in the historic Reformed tradition, which has always held a high view of congregational singing and the role of sacred music in forming the people of God.</p>
<h2>Psalmody and Hymnody</h2>
<p>We sing from the full breadth of the church''s musical heritage. The Psalms hold a privileged place in our worship, as they did for the early church and the Reformers. We sing metrical psalms, Genevan settings, and contemporary psalm arrangements alongside the great hymns of the Reformed and evangelical traditions — Watts, Wesley, Toplady, and the rich harvest of twentieth-century hymnody. Our organ and piano provide the primary accompaniment, with occasional use of other instruments appropriate to the worship context.</p>
<h2>The Chapel Choir</h2>
<p>Our choir rehearses each Thursday evening at 7:00 PM and sings most Sundays during the morning service. The choir''s role is to lead the congregation in worship and, on occasion, to offer anthems that serve as a musical exposition of the sermon text or liturgical theme. Singers of all levels are welcome, though we ask for a commitment to weekly rehearsal and regular Sunday participation. Auditions are informal — speak with our Director of Music to learn more.</p>
<h2>Musical Formation for All Ages</h2>
<p>We believe that musical formation begins in childhood. Our Sunday School curriculum includes instruction in hymnody and psalmody, and we encourage families to sing at home. We also offer occasional workshops on music and worship theology, open to the full congregation. If you are interested in serving in the Music Ministry — as a vocalist, instrumentalist, or sound technician — please contact us.</p>'

    '<h2>The Ministry of Mercy</h2>
<p>The Mercy Ministry of Saint Andrew''s Chapel is grounded in the biblical conviction that the church is called not only to proclaim the gospel in word but to embody it in deed. When Christ described the Final Judgment in Matthew 25, he pointed to acts of mercy — feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned — as evidence of living faith. We take that calling seriously, both within our congregation and in the wider community we serve.</p>
<h2>Care Within the Congregation</h2>
<p>The first sphere of mercy is the household of faith. When a member of Saint Andrew''s faces illness, job loss, a family crisis, or the ordinary sorrows of life, the Mercy Ministry coordinates the congregation''s response. This may include meal trains organized through our deacons, financial assistance from the Deacon''s Fund, visits from trained lay caregivers, or connection to professional counseling and community resources. We seek to ensure that no member of this body suffers alone.</p>
<h2>Outreach in the Community</h2>
<p>We also serve neighbors beyond our walls. Saint Andrew''s partners with local food banks, homeless shelters, and resettlement organizations to provide practical assistance to those in need. Members are encouraged to volunteer regularly and to bring their particular gifts — medical expertise, legal knowledge, financial counseling, language skills — to bear in service to the vulnerable. We believe that mercy ministry done well requires both generosity and wisdom.</p>
<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
<p>Mercy Ministry is not the work of a committee alone — it belongs to the whole congregation. If you are aware of a need within the church, please contact one of our deacons. If you would like to serve in community outreach, speak with our Mercy Coordinator. And if you are in need yourself, please do not hesitate to reach out — that is precisely what this ministry is here for.</p>'

    '<h2>Iron Sharpening Iron</h2>
<p>The Men''s Fellowship of Saint Andrew''s Chapel exists to build men who are rooted in Christ, committed to their families, faithful to the church, and engaged in the world for the glory of God. We believe that men need one another — not merely for camaraderie, but for the kind of honest, accountable friendship that Scripture calls us to. As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another (Proverbs 27:17).</p>
<h2>Monthly Prayer Breakfast</h2>
<p>We gather on the second Saturday of each month for a prayer breakfast in the Fellowship Hall. Each gathering includes a shared meal, a brief meditation on Scripture, time for open discussion of the text, and extended corporate prayer. We pray for our families, our church, our community, and the advance of Christ''s kingdom. The atmosphere is informal and welcoming — men of all ages and stages of spiritual maturity are encouraged to attend.</p>
<h2>Accountability and Discipleship</h2>
<p>Beyond the monthly gathering, we encourage men to form smaller accountability pairs or triads that meet weekly or biweekly. These informal relationships are the backbone of genuine discipleship among men. If you are new to the church or looking to be connected with a peer for mutual encouragement, speak with our Men''s Ministry Coordinator, who will help match you with another man at a similar stage of life and faith.</p>
<h2>Service and Leadership</h2>
<p>Men''s Fellowship also organizes periodic work days for church facility maintenance, assistance to widows and elderly members, and participation in community service projects. We believe that Christian manhood is expressed not in dominance but in sacrificial service — after the pattern of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. All men of the congregation, as well as friends and neighbors, are welcome to join us.</p>'
